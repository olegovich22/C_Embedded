# Reverse matrix

General algorithm sound like "reverse matrix = multiplication inverse determinant and transposition matrix algebraics additions"

So my algorithm consist of
1. Find determinant (here we have limitation because in the final formula we shoul use inverse determinant that means that it can't be zero. If determinant=0, impossible find reverse matrix)
2. Find minor matrix
3. Find a algebraics additions
4. Transposition

On this etap we already have all that we need to find reverse matrix.

More about this algorithm you can read on [this site](http://mathprofi.ru/kak_naiti_obratnuyu_matricu.html)
